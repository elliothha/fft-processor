If you had trouble on an earlier checkpoint, you may use these provided behavioral components instead of your own units.

NOTE: using your own components is graded more generously in the processor defense! We urge you to use your own modules unless your components are truly dysfunctional, since the processor tests are less strenuous on regfile and multdiv in particular.
